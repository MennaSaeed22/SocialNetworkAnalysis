# Social Network Analysis

Social Network Analysis (SNA) is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory.
This project implements tools and algorithms to analyze and visualize social networks, focusing on metrics and community structures.

## Project Overview
- **Graph Representation**: Load and represent social networks as graphs using various formats.
- **Centrality Metrics**: Compute centrality measures like degree, closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality.
- **Community Detection**: Detect communities in the network using algorithms such as modularity maximization and clustering.
- **Visualization**: Generate visualizations of the network and communities.
- **Metrics Analysis**: Analyze the structure and properties of the network, such as clustering coefficients and shortest paths.
